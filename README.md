# Project Overview
####These are the steps we should be undertaking:
1. Clone repository
2. Assign each person an issue to work on
3. Create branches to have each person work in
4. Complete each task and commit to each branch
5. When task is done merge/rebase with master


The second project is making a digital mental health helper (a chatbot:robot:) with NLP and Amazon Lex.
