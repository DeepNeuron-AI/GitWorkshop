How it works
Since the start of the project season reinforcement learning team has gone on a journey, through both theory and practical applications. Our load and savior, David Silver has been kind enough to deliver the basics to RL in 'easily digestable' lecture format. It has not been without its struggles. I would reccomend learning the basics well (especially terminology) before continuing or else you might feel overwhelmed.
