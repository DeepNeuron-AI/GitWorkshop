#Who are we
We are the dynamic balancing team from DeepNeuron. We are a reinforcement learning focused group working towards the end goal of 
having an AI dynamically balanced to always provide a reasonable challenge to the player.  Going forward this could be implemented by
game developers to help keep players engaged in the growing games market with a perfect challenge provided.


#Moar details.
This semester we are working our way up through reinforcement learning algorithms with Gym enviroments. We have implented a DQN to solve cartpole
before moving on to ATARI games and building up to a DDQN algorithm. When moving to ATARI we increased our networks by introducing CNN layers to 
extract features out of the screen. Moving forward we intend on developing actor critic and then PPO networks. Once these algorithms have been explored 
and our agent can kick ass we will return to the goal of dynamic balancing.
